# 浮生观止 · Fusheng Guanzhi

**A local-first, one-key-hidable private reader for classic Chinese & English texts (Windows)**

---

Fusheng Guanzhi is a reader whose **data never leaves your machine**. Import TXT / EPUB / Markdown and read offline,
with library & tag management, table-of-contents navigation, bookmarks and highlights, auto-saved reading progress, and
an AI panel that translates / explains the passage you select. It ships two privacy interactions for the "someone glancing
over your shoulder" case: **one-key hide** and a **focus overlay**.

This is the Windows verification build of the "Multi-device Private Reading App PRD v1.0", covering the full loop:
import → classify → read → hide & reveal → persist annotations/progress → AI-assisted passage help.

Stack: **React 18 + TypeScript + Electron** (no Rust on this machine, so Tauri was not chosen; the desktop hide
requirements are met with Electron windows / shortcuts / tray). The data layer is **SQLite (sql.js / WASM)**; text is stored
in a unified "chapter → paragraph → text" model, reserving the same core for future mobile and sync.

## Quick start

**Users — just download:**

Grab a build from the [Releases page](https://github.com/stohox/privacy-reader/releases):

- `浮生观止-便携版-x.y.z.exe` — portable single file, double-click to run.
- `浮生观止-安装版-x.y.z.exe` — installer with desktop / start-menu shortcuts.

> Unsigned: on first launch Windows SmartScreen shows "unknown publisher" — choose "More info → Run anyway".

**Developers — run from source:**

```bash
npm install        # npmmirror registry is preconfigured
npm run dev        # development (hot reload)
npm run build      # production build into out/
npm run dist:win   # package a double-clickable Windows app (output in dist/)
```

## How to use

**Import.** Go to *Import* and pick a local TXT / EPUB / Markdown file. After parsing you get a preview: edit title,
author, language, libraries and tags, review the chapter list and completeness. Dedup uses "filename + size + first-block
hash"; on a hit you can "open existing" or "keep as new version". Confirm to store it. Classification follows
"manual lock → user rules → keyword suggestion"; suggestions only show a reason and confidence and require your confirmation —
nothing is moved automatically.

**Library & reading.** *Library* browses everything by library/tag, with bulk move and delete (30-day trash).
Open a book to enter the reader: a left TOC jumps between chapters; the body supports in-book search, font size / line height /
typeface / three themes, bookmarks, and highlights (bound to chapter + paragraph + offset). Reading progress is saved locally every 5 seconds.

**AI passage help.** Select a passage in the reader and the right AI panel translates / explains / answers questions.
By default it sends the selection plus the two adjacent paragraphs (≤ 3000 chars) to the model; results are labeled "AI-assisted content"
and can be copied, saved as a note, regenerated, or cancelled. Configure any OpenAI-compatible endpoint in *Settings* (Base URL / Key / model);
the key is stored encrypted via the OS keystore.

**Privacy hide.** Press the hide shortcut at any time (default `Alt+Shift+H`): it first covers the text/title/notes/translation/AI panel,
then switches to a neutral "notes" screen. You can enable hide-on-blur, hide-on-idle, and lock-on-hide (PIN is a scrypt hash).
Forgetting the PIN only resets the local lock and clears protected text; other data is untouched. The tray menu (bottom-right) offers "Show / Quit".

**Focus overlay.** Press `Alt+Shift+Z` for focus view: the reading UI is de-book-ified (title, chapter header and progress hidden),
the window title becomes a neutral name, and the text floats softly over your desktop. In this state the window is
**click-through** to the desktop (everything except the text column and the control bar passes clicks to what's behind),
with a bottom control bar; `Ctrl+,` opens a quick panel for font size / column width / height / opacity / brightness / palette / always-on-top.
Press `Esc` twice to hide to the tray.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Alt + Shift + H` | One-key hide / reveal (global shortcut, default; changeable in Settings; falls back to in-app shortcut & the "Hide" button on conflict) |
| `Alt + Shift + Z` | Toggle focus view (stealth overlay) |
| `Ctrl + ,` | Open / close the quick panel (font size, column width/height, opacity, brightness, palette, always-on-top) |
| `Esc` | Close the panel; in focus view, press **twice** to hide to the tray |
| `Space` / `→` / `↓` / `PgDn` | Reader: next page (auto-advances to next chapter at the end) |
| `←` / `↑` / `PgUp` | Reader: previous page (auto-goes to previous chapter at the top) |
| `Home` / `End` | Reader: jump to start / end of the chapter |
| Mouse wheel | Reader: page by screen |
| `Ctrl` + wheel | Reader: zoom font size (12–32) |

## Packaging & distribution

electron-builder (see `electron-builder.yml`) wraps `out/` into a double-clickable Windows app:

```bash
npm run dist:win   # portable + installer, output in dist/
npm run icon       # regenerate build/ icons and the tray icon from export/export/desktop
```

Notes:

- App icon: `build/icon.ico` (multi-size), embedded into the exe and installer; the bottom-right tray uses `resources/tray.png`.
- Data lives in `%APPDATA%\privacy-reader` (`reader.db` and `settings.json`), shared by the portable and installed builds; uninstalling does not delete it.
- Single instance (`requestSingleInstanceLock`): a second launch exits immediately — a common cause of "double-click does nothing".
- Unsigned (no certificate): SmartScreen warns on first run; `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false` makes CI skip signing.

## Automated builds & downloads via GitHub Actions

The repo ships `.github/workflows/build.yml`:

- Push a `v*` tag (`git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`) → on `windows-latest` it runs `npm ci` + `npm run dist:win` → creates/updates a **GitHub Release** and uploads both exes as downloadable assets.
- Regular push / PR / manual trigger (Actions → "Run workflow") → builds only and attaches the binaries to that run's **Artifacts** (expire in ~90 days, for self-testing).

First time: repo Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → "Read and write permissions" so the Release step can publish.

## Mobile

This is an **Electron desktop app and cannot run on phones directly.** Going mobile needs a separate effort:

- **Capacitor shell**: reuse the React UI in `src/renderer`, but rewrite the data layer (no Node / no sql.js `fs` path / no Windows DPAPI on mobile) with Capacitor Filesystem + a WASM/native SQLite, and Keystore/Keychain for encryption.
- **React Native / Flutter rewrite**: better UX, but you rebuild the reader, import, privacy lock and AI help; the `src/shared` models serve as a cross-platform contract.
- The "hide / neutral screen / tray / global shortcut" desktop-only interactions must be redesigned for mobile (background snapshot protection, biometric unlock).

Recommendation: stabilize the Windows app and the `src/shared` data contract / sync interface first, then pick a route.

## Known limitations (honest for a verification build)

- Sync, web-URL import, and source adapters: data model and interfaces reserved only, no server wired up.
- Global shortcuts and task-switch preview protection need per-system testing; `SetWindowDisplayAffinity` capture protection is not enabled (P1).
- Chinese full-text search is a LIKE scan; a 100MB-scale library needs an FTS5 tokenizer approach.
- Mobile and macOS are out of scope for this version.

Test material is in `samples/`: full public-domain 《Water Margin》 (Project Gutenberg, 71 chapters), 《Romance of the Western Chamber》
(guwen.dao, five books / twenty-five acts), a classical Chinese TXT, an English TXT, and a minimal EPUB.
